## 🚀 Overview
This project is an AI-powered Fire & Smoke Detection System built with Flask and YOLOv10n. It allows users to detect fire and smoke in images, videos, and live camera feeds, triggering an alarm when a detection occurs. The system is designed for early fire detection and prevention, helping to minimize potential damage.

### 🔥 Features
- 📷  Image & Video Detection – Upload an image or video to detect fire & smoke.
- 🎥 Live Streaming Detection – Upload a video stream and detect fire in real-time.
- ✅ Live Camera Detection – Connect a webcam and detect fire instantly.
- 🚨 Alarm System – Alerts users when fire/smoke is detected.
- 📊 Performance Dashboard – View model performance metrics.
- ✅ Charts & Analysis – Graphical representation of detections.
